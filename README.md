# C-Plus-Plus-Blackjack
I cannot currently locate the code files, but will upload them once found. Until then, I have provided screenshots from the project's completion, showcasing some major development points:


# Modular Card System: 
Implemented a generic Card template; random number generation dynamically assigned its value and suit initials. (Creating each Card Display)

# Visual Game Display: 
The game featured a visual interface, clearly displaying the dealer's hand (including a hidden 'mystery' card) at the top and the user's hand below, rather than just text descriptions. (Playing Game)

# Robust Input Validation: 
I pride myself on implementing thorough input validation (to my current knowledge) to prevent crashes, ensuring only valid user inputs were accepted throughout the game. (Menu Code, OR Playing Game (Bottom))
